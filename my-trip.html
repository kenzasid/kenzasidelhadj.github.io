				<h2>Now more about my trip...</h2>
				<p>First, to be honest, before I came in Klaipeda, I didn't want to come, I was really afraid.
I was scared because of the language: English is not my first language and secondly, I didn't speak Lithuanian language at all.
After that, I was also scared to leave my family and live alone or with other people, to be responsible about my food, my laundry... and all theses things that we don't realize when we are in our "comfort zone".
So I just thought a lot of time, almost one month, and I said to myself that it's a big opportunities that I will never have again.
Then I booked my flight without thinking twice.
When I arrived here, I had my first trouble: My shuttle from the airport to LCC lost my luggage, it was really hard for me because I came in a new country, with new people, new language, and new way of life... But 2 days after this I took back my luggage.
After few weeks, I had met lots of people with many different cultures; I had discovered the city Klaipeda and some parts of the country.

After a month, I started to travel: I went to Riga with my friends for a weekend.
During this week-end we visited the city, we went to some local restaurants, we sang in a Karaoke bar, we drunk tea in some coffee shop and had really good time with my friends.

Then, in February my parents came to visit me, I had good time with them and it was really good for me to see them again.

In March, I will travel in Sweden, poland and may be estonia, I will try to post some pictures of these trip in this website.
